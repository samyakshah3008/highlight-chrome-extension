Problem statement:

While reading articles or something important, we often feel to save some paragraphs for later purpose to revisit. Now to keep all of them under one roof, you can now use this chrome extension to save them and check back to it whenever you want. Currently you can add as many items, also can delete any item which you want.

Next possible improvements -

- Publish to chrome web store
- Good CSS
- Summarize all highlights with AI
- Add categories and divide highlights into those specific cateogories.
- Flashcards for learning with AI
